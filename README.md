# Quantum Computing (Title Will Change)
This is my BT Young Scientist Project for 2016 - 2017

Its mainly focusing on:
* Programming a 'Universally Complete' Quantum Computer Simulation
* Designing a Programming Language that interacts with the 2 systems seamlessly, as if they were one.

## Generating the Report PDF
You need to have a LaTex Distrobution installed, and to generate it, run the command:
`$ pdflatex report/main.tex`
And you should see the file `main.pdf`, which should be the report
